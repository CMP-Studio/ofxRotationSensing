ofxRotationSensing
=====================================

Introduction
------------
This addon features a class that can determine the rotational velocity of a vector when given it's position relative to the center of a circle. When used in conjunction with optical flow, it can be useful for projects in need of rotation sensing from a live feed or recorded video.


This addon was created by [The Innovation Studio](https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/) as a part of [The Light Clock](https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/clock-9aa6da28a4e5#.tkqzwzuk4). The example included is a version of the code used for that project.
